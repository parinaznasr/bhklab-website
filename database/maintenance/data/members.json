    "bio": "Alex graduated with an undergraduate degree in computer science from U of T, and is currently pursuing a Master's degree. He is interested in creating robust neural network models for a variety of vision applications. He has experience working with histology images, and is currently shifting his focus to radiology. Alex is keen on understanding and fixing failure modes of neural networks, and he believes this will eventually lead to increased model interpretability. This focus stems from an understanding that hospitals are reluctant to adopt new technologies that have not been thoroughly tested. His recent interest in model security in the context of adversarial examples has lead him to develop several defence schemes that may have transferability to less security intensive applications.",

During his PhD studies, his research focused on mathematical modeling of anti-cancer therapy induced secondary cancer risks, and, also worked on spatial evolutionary modeling on networks to understand cancer progression in real tissues. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Masters in Mathematics from Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada and a Masters in Mathematics (with specialization in Computer Science) from Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, India. Currently, he is employing his mathematical and computational skills to model the crosstalk between the tumor epithelia and stroma in malignant breast cancers, and potentially identify chemotherapeutic agents that can inhibit these interactions.",
